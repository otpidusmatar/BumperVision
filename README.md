***Experiments with FRC Robot Bumper Detection and Tracking on Field***

**Current Progress:**
- Trained accurate YOLOv8 robot and note detection model
- Implemented optical flow algorithm to track detected robot bounding boxes
- Created script to adjust FPS for testing latency effects with video samples

**To-Do:**
- Process vectors of optical flow motion tracking
- Simplify to easily interpreted "likelihood of note collection" variable based on vector and distance of opponent robot
- Design convenient GUI-based tool to test code
